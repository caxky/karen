# Karen
Karen is a small C++ based game revolving around the idea of lost souls. The players main objective is to free the souls of those who were trapped in the half dimension. These souls are Jacob, Peter, and Malik. The player is guided by an archangel named Michael, who helps them along the way. Three levels have to be completed, one for each lost soul, in order to complete the game. Each level consists of finding the lost soul, and then completing a small minigame.
